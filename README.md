# About

This API can be used to Encrypt a string and get back a key

Our API will take in a string to encrypt. Then send that to an encryped file.
You will be able to choose what kind of encryption you would like to use in the case you want to decript later.

A list of popular encrypting algorithms will be listed...

It will then return a string thats going to be the password.
